# Scaling_Techniques via python.

# There are many ways to scaling features :
1- Absolute Maximum Scaling
2- Min-Max Scaling
3- Normalization
4- Standardization
5- Robust Scaling


in this repo. we just apply Standardization on 


In standardization, we calculate the z-value for each of the data points and replaces those with these values

# The standardization method uses this formula:

z = (x - u) / s

Where z is the new value, x is the original value, u is the mean and s is the standard deviation.
